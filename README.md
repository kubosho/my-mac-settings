## üîß Prerequisites

- OS - macOS (recommended: macOS 11 Big Sur or later)
- Dependencies - Git
- Permissions - Some settings require administrator privileges

## üì¶ Installation

### Apply all settings at once

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kubosho/my-mac-settings.git

# Run the setup script
cd my-mac-settings
./setup.sh

# After completion, remove the repository if no longer needed
cd ../
rm -rf my-mac-settings/
```

### Apply settings individually

To apply only specific settings, run scripts individually:

```bash
# Example: Apply only Finder settings
./finder.sh

# Example: Install only Homebrew
./homebrew/brew-install.sh
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cautions

- Impact of settings - These scripts modify system settings. It's recommended to review the contents before execution
- Backup - It's recommended to backup important settings beforehand
- Restart - Some settings take effect after restart

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If permission errors occur

```bash
# Grant execution permissions to all scripts
chmod +x *.sh homebrew/*.sh
```

### If specific settings are not applied

1. Restart the relevant application
2. Restart macOS
3. Verify settings are applied using `defaults read` command
