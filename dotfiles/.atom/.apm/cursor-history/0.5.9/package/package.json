You need to set by yourself.  \n\n* e.g.\n\n```coffeescript\n'atom-workspace':\n  'ctrl-i':     'cursor-history:next'\n  'ctrl-o':     'cursor-history:prev'\n  'ctrl-cmd-i': 'cursor-history:next-within-editor'\n  'ctrl-cmd-o': 'cursor-history:prev-within-editor'\n```\n\n# Commands\n\n* `cursor-history:next`: Go to next point in history.\n* `cursor-history:prev`: Go to previous point in history.\n* `cursor-history:next-within-editor`: Go to next point in history within current editor.\n* `cursor-history:prev-within-editor`: Go to previous point in history within current editor.\n* `cursor-history:clear`: Clear history.\n\n# Features\n\n* Go and Back to prev/next position of cursor history including closed buffer(can exclude closed buffer with config option).\n* Flash cursor line on land. Can disable, customize flash color, duration and type(line, word, point).\n* Vim like history concatnation(Never save same line per file. This allow you to jump specific line only once).\n* Auto adjust cursor position to middle of screen if target was off-screen.\n\n# When cursor history saved?\n\n* when editor lost focus.\n* when cursor position's row delta exceeds rows specified by `rowDeltaToRemember`(default 4).\n\n# TODO\n- [x] Spec\n- [x] Don't use editor.onDidChangeCursorPosition, use atom.commands.onDidDispatch instead.\n- [ ] Support serialization to support per-project cursor history.\n- [x] Configuration option to exclude closed buffer.\n- [x] Ensure not open un-existing file.\n- [x] Flash cursor line when target is off-screen.\n- [x] Adjust cursor position after jump to middle of screen.\n- [x] Configurable option to keep current pane on history excursion with `prev`, `next`.\n- [x] Update history entry on file rename(`onDidChangePath`).\n- [x] Don't save history when multiple cursors.\n- [x] Use oldBufferPosition rather than newBufferPosition to save.\n- [x] Exclude inValid Marker. deleted File(URI).\n- [x] Better history concatenation(Vim-like).\n- [x] Use Marker if I can, use Point for destroyed editor to avoid error.\n- [x] Save history on ActiveTextEditor change.\n- [x] Better integration with symbols-view's FileView, ProjectView.\n- [x] Better integration with symbols-view's GoToView, GoBackView\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/t9md/atom-cursor-history/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/t9md/atom-cursor-history#readme","_id":"cursor-history@0.5.9","_shasum":"4660d4c013b6ad052cd90b96e89df8fd2607ae5f","_resolved":"file:../d-11601-11624-7lpds8/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11601-11624-7lpds8/package.tgz"}
